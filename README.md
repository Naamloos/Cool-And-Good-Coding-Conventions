Now that the losers are gone let's get to the real talk. To be a good coder you need GOOD code. Let's talk GOOD code. The GOODEST there is. The BESTEST GOODEST CODE.

## Bracing style
pffftfptpft!! Who needs consistency? Your code just has to _work_. Readability is a meme. Just make sure your braces never match up the previous brace.

```c
public void cOOLANDGOODMETHOD(              int sTUFF  
          )
{
                  dOSHIT(



    );
     if
    (
        sOSHIT){                   dOMORESHIT();    }
        }
```

## Indentation
Yo, why care about indentation? just place however many spaces you feel like. And sometimes a tab just to throw people off. F*ck you Karen from HR!

She probably won't read the code anyway but it's just in case.

## Casing
The best casing style is aNGRYCASE. Always use aNGRYCASE!!!!!!!!!!!

Use this for anything. I don't care about your privates. Stop sending me pics, Josh.

```c
public void tHISISANANGRYCASEMETHOD(int iNPUT)                      {
                     dOSHITRIGHTNOW(   );}
```

## Comments
No. People will steal your code if they understand what it does.

## Naming conventions
Make sure to give your code some creativity by choosing one of the following naming conventions:
- Smashing your keyboard
- Random words (like `rAINBOWsHIT`)
- Use a password generator
- Random GUID
- Using random characters out of the Unicode table (including 👏😎⭐👌👌🤢)

Using these make sure you'll never jump into any naming problems.

## Oh right
never use for loops, they suck. just while

```c
int i = 0;
while(i < 10)
                        {
    // who needs for loops?
    // this is not a comment
    i++;}
```

## Summaries
Just summarize everything but make sure to be very very very very very very very concise and make sure other devs have no fucking clue what you are talking about

```c
/// So basically this code below does the thing where it kinda fixes that one issue ya know
// I can't code
```

## Licensing
Licenses are for pussies

## Operating system
Only dev on TempleOS with HolyC

## Inheritance
Try to obtain full inheritance via endless legal battles.

## Management of sensitive data
Who needs config files? Just hard code that shit

## Documentation
You expected people to use your code?

## Your political agenda
Also make sure to push your political ideology with your code!
```c
// I hate people with tiny fucking hands. They should be deported.
```

And make sure to end every source file with a watermark.

```c
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////ifunny.c🙂//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

## Version Control
I really like Dropbox sync. It's pretty cool and it just makes sure to sync your files with the one your buds have

## Databases
Use an excel lib

## Testing
Just run it on Kali Linux so you can see whether it gets hakced.
